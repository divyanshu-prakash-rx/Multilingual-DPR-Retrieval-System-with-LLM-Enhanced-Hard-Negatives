The first, and major, source is that oxygen is liberated as a by-product of photosynthetic chemical reactions. The second source occurs in the atmosphere itself when water molecules are split apart after being struck with ultraviolet radiation. This process is called photolysis. The molecule is broken down into one diatomic hydrogen molecule and one free oxygen. The hydrogen molecule is light, and has a quick thermal velocity,so it can escape Earth's atmosphere leaving behind the free oxygen to form a diatomic oxygen molecule. The main source of this atmospheric water was volcanic eruptions and outgassing.

what is the major source atmospheric of oxygen,"Answer 1: The oxygen that we currently find in the air has two main sources. The first, and major, source is that oxygen is liberated as a by-product of photosynthetic chemical reactions. The second source occurs in the atmosphere itself when water molecules are split apart after being struck with ultraviolet radiation. This process is called photolysis. The molecule is broken down into one diatomic hydrogen molecule and one free oxygen. The hydrogen molecule is light, and has a quick thermal velocity,so it can escape Earth's atmosphere leaving behind the free oxygen to form a diatomic oxygen molecule. The main source of this atmospheric water was volcanic eruptions and outgassing. Basically before photosynthesis began on large scales, free oxygen molecules in the atmosphere were drawn down in oxidation reactions with free metal ions on the Earth's surface, mainly iron.","The arteriovenous oxygen difference, or a-vO 2 diff, is the difference in the oxygen content of the blood between the arterial blood and the venous blood.
